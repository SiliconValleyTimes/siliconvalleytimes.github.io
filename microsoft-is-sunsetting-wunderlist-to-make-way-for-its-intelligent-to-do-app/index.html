Wait, what?</p> <p>Let’s rewind a little. Along the startup’s recent history, that is. Not the movie.</p> <p>Back in June 2015, Microsoft acquired the German startup that built Wunderlist — just months after it was ranked the best task management app by The Verge in 2014.</p> <p>At the time of the purchase, Microsoft’s general manager of OneNote Eran Megiddo commented in an official company blog post, “The addition of Wunderlist to the Microsoft product portfolio fits squarely with our ambition to reinvent productivity for a mobile-first, cloud-first world.”</p> <p>From Wunderlist’s perspective, founder and CEO Christian Reber published in a separate blog post at the time, “So what will change for you? Nothing right now. Our team in Berlin will continue to build and deliver you Wunderlist, Wunderlist Pro and Wunderlist for Business across all platforms [...]”</p> <p>Meggido’s blog post was closed off to public comments, while Reber’s post on Wunderlist’s website attracted 1,000+ comments from fans and avid users — who were mostly disappointed by the acquisition news. They would prefer if Wunderlist remained a focused, standalone product whose design and features were precisely what they were after.</p> <p>Users’ disappointment turned into anger as Microsoft announced last week that it would be shutting down Wunderlist for good. So why would the Redmond tech giant buy the startup only to kill it less than two years later? It will probably make more sense if we look at Microsoft’s real gains behind the acquisition.</p> <h2>What did Microsoft get out of it?</h2> <p>By sealing the deal with Wunderlist, the Father of Animated Paper Clip also adopted — by extension — the app’s 13+ million users and 1 billion of to-do items created by these users. To put that into perspective, if you were to list an average of 20 to-dos per day, it would take you 13,699 *years* to reach a billion to-dos. Let’s just hope your device manages to survive that many years of recommended updates!</p> <p>On a more serious note, for Wunderlist to rise to the top of the productivity app game in as few as under 5 years, its team are presumed to be incredibly talented. In the business world these days, it’s not uncommon for tech giants to buy up smaller players as a talent acquisition move. On the opposite side of the table, joining larger companies gives startup unicorns more resources to realize their next visions. It’s usually quite the win-win situation, just as the Wunderlist purchase might have been.</p> <p>Some have also speculated that it was a move for Microsoft to eliminate competition, though this has not been confirmed.</p> <p>Between the app’s popularity and substantial user base, acquiring it would also help grow Microsoft’s own product portfolio, including Office 365.</p> <h2>What is Microsoft doing to Wunderlist today?</h2> <p>It has been announced that Wunderlist is to be retired and replaced by Microsoft To-Do. In other words, the once-beloved indie brand will soon be fully absorbed into the MS portfolio.</p> <p>Microsoft has assured users that the shutdown won’t occur until all of Wunderlist’s features have been migrated to To-Do. Kind of makes you wonder how many to-do tasks that process involves, no?</p> <p>An importer is also being rolled out by Microsoft to ensure a smooth transition from Wunderlist to To-Do. Some users have reported problems with the importer in various forums and comments sections. That said, Microsoft is among the many tech companies that often release bug fixes via app updates.</p> <p>One collective user complaint that has yet to be addressed, is the fact that To-Do needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account. Some long-time Wunderlist fans are refusing to make the switch, and are instead seeking alternatives like Todoist and Trello.</p> <h2>What’s missing here?</h2> <p>From a product marketing standpoint, there is one aspect that both Microsoft and Wunderlist may have overlooked or underestimated — namely, brand loyalty.</p> <p>Sure, Wunderlist’s awesome backbone features — and not its identity, per se — are probably what appeal to its users most to begin with. But let’s not forget that early adopters also tend to be extremely loyal to the brands they put their trust into. People love Wunderlist for being Wunderlist. What’s happening now might even be seen by some fans as some sort of betrayal.</p> <p>For a rather random example, say if Starbucks were to acquire Philz Coffee and then integrate all of Philz’s coffee-crafting secrets into Starbucks’ in-house brewing methods, Philz’s loyal patrons still might not automatically become Starbucks customers. To them, nothing can replace Philz culture. (Yes, right now my brain is telling me that I need coffee.)</p> <p>So how are things looking for To-Do? Not necessarily bad. Between new / existing Microsoft users and a portion of Wunderlist users who don’t mind the switch, To-Do may grow just fine.</p> <h2>What’s new in To-Do?</h2> <p>One interesting new feature that caught people’s eyes, is To-Do’s “Intelligent Suggestions.” It’s implemented to show you unfinished tasks from the day before, what’s due or upcoming, and — wait for it — suggestions offered by its AI algorithm.</p> <h2>“Wait, will the bot start taking over my identity?”</h2> <p>No, it won’t. At least not yet.</p> <p>The way this feature currently seems to work, is by analyzing data from your past entries to come up with new task suggestions. So for example, say you have been manually tasking yourself with item “volunteer at pet shelter” every Saturday consistently. And if you partied too hard one Friday night and forgot all about the puppies who needed care the next morning, “Intelligent Suggestions” may come in handy.</p> <p>Or maybe that’s not how it’s supposed to work at all. I’m not sure.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that your To-Do data is highly likely to be shared with other Office 365 apps — and vice versa. So if it’s marked on your calendar that your best friend Bob’s birthday is next Thursday, To-Do might suggest that you pick up a gift for Bob.</p> <p>And as with most algorithm-driven products, the more data you provide, the “smarter” To-Do gets over time. Keep using the app, and there may come a day when it knows more about your traits and habits than you do yourself. Whoa...</p> <p>But then again, a good amount of us probably don’t think it’s that big of a deal.</p> <p>In the age of rapid technological advancements, it’s becoming increasingly commonplace for tech users to “sacrifice” privacy for convenience or even efficiency. Where exactly do we draw the line?</p> <p>For now, I am just going to finish my decent cup of coffee while rewatching Minority Report for the 19th time. <strong>∎</strong></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
