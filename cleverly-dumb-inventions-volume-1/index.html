Perhaps it was when Japanese inventor and magazine editor Kenji Kawakami coined the term <a href="https://www.chindogu.com">&quot;Chindogu&quot;</a> back in the 1990s, which depicts &quot;the art of inventing ingenious everyday gadgets that seem like an ideal solution to a particular problem, but are in fact useless.&quot;</p> <p>Millennials in English-speaking countries might have only heard of a more modern, tech-infused version, popularized by the <a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com">Stupid Hackathon</a>. The Stupid Hackathon is basically “a one-day event where participants conceptualize and create projects that have no value whatsoever.&quot;</p> <p>I have always had a weakness for &quot;useless&quot; inventions that may look dumb on a superficial level, but are indeed powered by thorough design process or even -- in some cases -- profoundly dedicated tech implementations.</p> <p>After all, as Steve Jobs once said, &quot;the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.&quot;</p> <p>And getting your brainchilds (no matter how trivial) out there is a good starting point for bigger and better projects to follow. If nothing else, you would at least have that much more experience building things from scratch.</p> <p>To celebrate the art of carefully designed and built things that are utterly &quot;useless,&quot; the Silicon Valley Times is featuring an inaugural award presentation.</p> <p>In this first volume, a total of three cleverly dumb inventions have been handpicked.</p> <h2>#3 -- InspiroBot</h2> <p>InspiroBot is &quot;an artificial intelligence dedicated to generating unlimited amounts of unique inspirational quotes for endless enrichment of pointless human existence.&quot;</p> <p>Let’s see what they've got:</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_InspiroBot-01.jpg" alt="InspiroBot 01"></p> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_InspiroBot-02.jpg" alt="InspiroBot 02"></p> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_InspiroBot-03.jpg" alt="InspiroBot 03"></p> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_InspiroBot-04.jpg" alt="InspiroBot 04"></p> <br> <p>What a deep soul, if you ask me.</p> <p><a href="http://inspirobot.me/">(Link)</a></p> <h2>#2 -- Is your cat plotting to kill you?</h2> <p>If you are a fan of The Oatmeal’s, you may have already seen this storyline before. Matt Inman, creator of The Oatmeal webcomics, is nice enough to warn us of signs that our cat wants to murder us.</p> <p>Matt has now launched an iOS app in collaboration with his developer brother, Nick Inman. With this app, you will be able to keep tabs on your cat’s intent any time of the day, anywhere you are.</p> <p>I certainly had a few good laughs reading the customer &quot;testimonials&quot;:</p> <p>“This app saved my life.”
— Barbara Higgins, Arkansas</p> <p>“If this had existed 10 years ago, my husband would still be alive.”
— Nancy Merrifield, Florida</p> <p>“this app is dumb awful bad garbage”
— a cat</p> <p>By the way, as the results below show, my life is doomed. And here I thought my imaginary kitty was all sweet and cuddly...</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_catapp-01.png" alt="Cat app"></p> <br> <p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/catapp">(Link)</a></p> <h2>#1 -- Not Hotdog</h2> <p>I have already introduced Not Hotdog in a previous <a href="https://siliconvalleytimes.com/alphago-not-hotdog/">article</a>, which loosely touches upon the tech and machine learning behind building it.</p> <p>Kudos to HBO writers for coming up with this fake product for the Silicon Valley show. Meanwhile, credit should also go to Tim Anglade, the show’s consultant who made the effort to build the app in real life — behind the scenes.</p> <p>In spite of the app’s uselessness on the surface, building it was not a walk in the park at all. It’s basically a fully functioning artificial intelligence (AI) system.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_Not-Hotdog-01.jpg" alt="Not Hotdog 01"></p> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-07_cleverly-dumb-inventions-volume-1_Not-Hotdog-02.jpg" alt="Not Hotdog 02"></p> <br> <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/not-hotdog/id1212457521">(Link)</a></p> <p>More to come in the next volume.
