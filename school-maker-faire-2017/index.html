It continues to cultivate an engaging atmosphere for makers to showcase what they have made, and to share what they have learned with like-minded enthusiasts. Featured in a Maker Faire are innovation and hands-on experimentation across the spectrum of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (also known as STEAM).</p> <p>Maker Movement Founder Dale Dougherty thinks the world is what we make it: “I believe we are all makers. We can find all kinds of makers in our communities. Yet we also want to help create more makers. Through education and community outreach, we can offer the opportunity to make things to more people, but particularly children.”</p> <p>“My goal is that all people, young and old, come to see themselves as makers, creators and doers because I know that the people who have the skills and knowledge to make things have the power to make the world a better place,” Dougherty expressed.</p> <p>Currently, flagship Maker Faires take place across the United States in the San Francisco Bay Area (which houses Silicon Valley), Chicago, and New York.</p> <p>What if you are not in close proximity to any of those regions? The good news is, alternative options to get involved are aplenty.</p> <h3>Putting “maker spirit” to good use</h3> <p><a href="http://www.pakkau.edu.hk">Pak Kau College</a> in Hong Kong recently launched its inaugural School Maker Faire, creating an inclusive playground for students to experience the maker culture with their own eyes -- and hands!</p> <p>I was (all but literally) jumping for joy when I first received the invitation to the event. Fortunately, as did the hundreds of students I saw that day -- both the exhibiting makers and the keen visitors who excitedly went from booth to booth.</p> <p>Below are some photo highlights from the School Maker Faire. Meet tomorrow’s scientists, engineers, and world-changers:</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-28_school-maker-faire_01.jpg" alt="01"></p> <h6>Pak Kau College Supervisor Prof. Tam Man Kwan engages students in thought-provoking questions during his opening address.
