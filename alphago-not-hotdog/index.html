As researchers are getting more invested in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems than ever, we might start seeing more and more AIs and robots taking center stage in news coverage, technology-related and otherwise.</p> <p>Case in point: This rising star has taken the title of Go champion from the world’s best players for the third time. Who exactly are we looking at here? An AI robot named AlphaGo.</p> <h2>You and I make excellent benchmark test subjects</h2> <p>A quick search on “AlphaGo” will give you a whole host of news articles detailing its victory. We can only expect to see more and more AI-powered entities participating in human-versus-machine competitions. And that makes perfect sense. After all, one of the goals of AI advancements is to ultimately out-perform humans in everyday activities -- especially in areas where human-centric constraints are not limiting AIs as much, if at all. With that in mind, competing against humans naturally becomes a logical way to measure progress of an AI system.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the line is also getting blurred in the show business.</p> <p>A quick introduction for those who are not the most up-to-date with television shows: Meet Jian-Yang, a fictional character from HBO’s sitcom “Silicon Valley.” In the show, it is remained unclear whether the character’s last name is Jian or Yang. But that’s not important here. What we just need to know for now, is that in a recent episode, this Jian-Yang guy launched an app that lets users take a photograph of something before evaluating whether the subject is a... uh, hot dog or not.</p> <p>What’s so special about this particular scene? The more intriguing part has yet to come.</p> <h2>Opening doors for cross-promotion opportunities</h2> <p>Much to fans’ surprise, it was then announced that the aforementioned app had actually been uploaded to Apple’s App Store -- in real life, that is. The app is dubbed, “Not Hotdog.”</p> <p>In other words, someone actually built the app bit by bit (quite literally) to coincide with the satirical show’s new episode launch! Wondered who that someone might be? I have more on that later.</p> <p>But first, when was the last time a similar PR stunt was pulled in show biz? Perhaps it was when the “Back to the Future II” team partnered with Nike to release a prototype of the self-lacing shoes -- only, it was a whole 30 years after the movie’s original premiere in 1985.</p> <p>Not Hotdog, on the other hand, was released almost simultaneously.</p> <p>And with signups so easy that everyone’s cat has its own social media accounts these days, it must have been a breeze for HBO to set up “fake but official” online identities for Jian-Yang. That helps their campaign, too.</p> <p>Hollywood and other filmmakers could probably take notes here as well. A real-life product launch to align with a virtual on-screen one sounds like a fantastic cross-promotion idea. Having said that, let’s just all hope this isn’t something that will become overdone anytime soon.</p> <p>Now, remember I said AlphaGo and Not Hotdog were *seemingly* unrelated? As it turns out, they share more similarities than you might think!</p> <h2>More Than Meats (Wait, Meets) the Eye</h2> <p>You may be skeptical at this point. And no, I don’t mean that the two are similar merely because they both utilize AI.</p> <p>Before I go on, I would like to first talk a bit about the behind-the-scenes person who actually built the Not Hotdog app. Behind all the glory of Jian-Yang’s debut product is the awesome work of Tim Anglade, with the support of the “Silicon Valley” crew. Anglade officially serves as a technical consultant on the show, and is a guest lecturer at Stanford.</p> <p>I was able to hunt down Anglade’s contribution to a post on Hacker News, which gives great insights into the app’s inner workings. As much as it is common tech world practice to under-credit individual developers, I think the work that went behind Not Hotdog deserves some spotlight as well.</p> <p>Without further ado, what do a sophisticated board game-winning program and an app that... well, screens hot dogs have in common? Let’s dive right in.</p> <h2>1. Single purpose only</h2> <p>As impressive as both systems might be, AlphaGo and Not Hotdog are a long way from general-purpose AI. That means they won’t be taking over humankind just yet. At their current state, they are only good at one -- and solely one -- task that they are specifically designed to perform.</p> <p>AlphaGo might have beat the world’s best players at Go, but guess what? It can’t identify a single hot dog to save its life!</p> <p>Likewise, as you can probably tell by now, Not Hotdog would be at a complete loss at any board game we throw at it.</p> <h2>2. They both have a highly evolved “brain”</h2> <p>Without getting too much into the technical details, let’s just say that AlphaGo and Not Hotdog are brainy -- to a confined degree. They are able to solve problems and make decisions in real time.</p> <p>Before you get scared by this: Don’t forget, right now they are really only “thinking” about Go boards and hot dogs, respectively. Single purpose is at play here.</p> <p>For those who are interested in some tech specifics, the two systems are results of deep machine learning developed with neural networks. More specifically, convolutional neural networks. Convolutional networks are a sub-class of neural networks that are particularly good at processing image data.</p> <p>You might not think AlphaGo needs image processing at all. On the contrary, its computer vision is able to “see” game states as images, whereby passing them to the “brain” for processing.</p> <h2>3. Their “brains” are powered by the same thing</h2> <p>In order to support the deep learning specified above, a substantial amount of computation power is required. This is where Google’s open-source TensorFlow came in handy.</p> <p>In a research blog post published by Google’s DeepMind team -- the creator of AlphaGo -- it can be confirmed that TensorFlow was indeed deployed in AlphaGo’s backend system.</p> <p>Tim Anglade also pointed out in his forum post that he used TensorFlow in the process of developing Not Hotdog.</p> <p>This is something that I am both surprised and delighted to learn about, as it gives hopes for smaller development teams across the globe to create amazing things. If being a one-man band isn’t stopping Tim (Anglade), what’s our excuse? Right?</p> <p>The success of AlphaGo and Not Hotdog may appear overnight, but the extensive work that went into their development is anything but. Let’s continue to look at more commonalities between the two.</p> <h2>4. They went through a ton of training</h2> <p>“Practice makes perfect” is true even in the AI world. Often times, developers face difficulties not only in building the underlying system, but also in finding ways to train the system to improve its performance.</p> <p>AlphaGo in particular was learning from the best. At first, it was trained with data of 80 years worth of gameplay, compiled from the experiences of many world winners of Go.</p> <p>The training didn’t end there. It was then set up to play against itself over and over, further fine-tuning its Go skills.</p> <p>Not Hotdog wasn’t born to be good at identifying hot dogs right off the bat. It went through 150K images (of which 3K are pictures of hot dogs) before becoming App Store-ready.</p> <p>It is also possible that the app can further train itself on user-submitted images. So think twice before bombarding it with those not-safe-for-work (NSFW) pics!</p> <h2>5. They can both do so much more</h2> <p>Last but not least, the implications for the future are what many are truly excited about.</p> <p>We are in fact looking at great prospects.</p> <p>AI systems that boast reliable image recognition techniques (albeit with a lot of room for improvement, to be fair), can solve problems and make decisions in real time, and can even learn from experience will continue to change the world in ways unimaginable decades ago.</p> <p>Among other AI problems, self-driving cars represent one technological vertical that is benefiting from the remarkable breakthroughs.</p> <p>Following AlphaGo’s latest win, DeepMind has indeed announced that they will be retiring the program and focusing more of their energy on more challenging problems. I, for one, am keen to see what comes next.</p> <p>Where are we being driven? Everywhere. Anywhere we want. Soon. Hopefully. And I don’t just mean on the road. <b>∎</b></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
