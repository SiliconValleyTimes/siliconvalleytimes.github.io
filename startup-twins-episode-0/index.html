What’s even crazier, is that I am just going to go ahead and do it. I am going to build -- not one, but -- two startups at the same time.</p> <h3>Build once, run many times -- software or startup?</h3> <p>In the programming world, we are often huge fans of the “build once, run everywhere” (BORE) philosophy. It depicts an ideal situation where a program only needs to be built once, and can subsequently run on any platform.</p> <p>In modern-day web or mobile development, BORE-dom (sorry, had to) can sometimes be a developer’s worst nightmare. Let’s say you have a tool that lets you build a mobile application, which will then spit out both iOS- and Android-compatible packages. Sounds awesome, right? Guess what, these tools already exist.</p> <p>Except we now have another problem. Developers would often need to spend a lot of time on adaptation work, in order to make sure the “same” build really works 100% across iPhones and Android phones. To add insult to injury, the systemic adaptation work usually involves pretty BORE-ing tasks.</p> <p>From a higher level efficiency perspective, however, BORE does indeed beat building two separate apps from scratch.</p> <p>But I digress.</p> <h3>Double trouble, or 20-80, or something else?</h3> <p>What if I used a similar approach to build companies?</p> <p>If building one company requires X amount of work. Theoretically speaking, building two at once will require 2X of work done.</p> <p>The way I see it though, steps of building a company can remain very similar across different entities. This is especially true during early stages.</p> <h3>“Concurrent Projects Methodology”</h3> <p>By creating more than one startup project in parallel, I may be able to leverage the shared resources to maximize the results. I have been secretly calling this management methodology -- “Concurrent Projects Methodology”. It is akin to, for example, when two programs on your computer share the same CPU resources and can still run smoothly, simultaneously.</p> <p>Is it really going to work? I don’t know for sure. But I have always liked to perform hands-on experiments to find out answers for myself.</p> <p>“Startup Twins” will be my next experiment.</p> <h3>Worst-case scenario</h3> <p>Won’t I just end up being unfocused? How burned out will I get?</p> <p>Now, rather than dwelling on the potential cons of this approach, I am just going to save us all time and dive straight into the worst-case scenario.</p> <p>What’s the worst that could happen? Both of the startups would fail.</p> <p>I know we all seek different things in life. To me in particular, having built two startups that end up failing doesn’t sound too bad at all. But then of course, I have to entertain the bottom line -- I will have to be extra cautious when employment starts getting into the picture.</p> <h3>Like a science experiment</h3> <p>Remember those science experiments you did when you were a kid in school? There’s no guaranteed success. You might fail, you might not achieve the results you wanted -- no matter how hard you tried. But you would always learn a ton along the process.</p> <p>I am starting my experiment now. As I said at the beginning, I am aware that it is a crazy idea. If you are curious about how I get on, you are invited to follow along on all my trial and errors. They will be promptly documented in this blog series as I go.</p> <h3>What about you? What’s your story?</h3> <p>Whether you are already far down your startup journey, or are still thinking about starting something, I would love to hear from you.</p> <p>You are more than welcome to join our Facebook Group to network with fellow entrepreneurs. Who knows -- you may even meet your future project partners or collaborators there!</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/238137726695664/">Click here</a> to join now.</p> <h3>What’s next?</h3> <p>Next time, I will talk more about what I am building, and why I chose to build them in particular.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
