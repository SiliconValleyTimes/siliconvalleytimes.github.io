Likewise, when Mark Zuckerberg got accepted into Harvard, he was living in an era where everyone had only ever heard of yearbook, notebook -- but not Facebook.</p> <p>Thanks in no small part to these tech leaders’ innovative contribution, our lives have since transformed by orders of magnitude. The best part? There is so much more on the horizon, still. Accelerated human connectivity is but a milestone along the road to even bigger revolutions. The myriad of resources made available to us as a result means innovative ideas can be spread faster than ever, and literally without borders.</p> <p>Look at artificial intelligence (AI) alone. Not only is the number of new research projects growing by the day, more and more discoveries are also being made open-source for a much wider reach. The knowledge spread is thus explosive. From here on out, technological innovation will only continue to grow at an unprecedented, exponential rate.</p> <p>The world is in a distinctly different place than it was merely 10 years ago. In the third quarter of 2016, for the first time ever, the top five publicly traded companies by market capitalization were dominated by tech names. This trend has since been gaining traction and momentum. Back in 2006 (before iPhone was even born), only one software company (namely, Microsoft) had made it onto the top five list.</p> <br> <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5403/most-valuable-companies-2006-vs-2016/"><p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_ifuture-education-conference_chart-1.png" alt="chart"></p></a> <br> <p>That’s not all. Among the top five from the latest rankings, four are now aggressively spearheading AI initiatives. Joining them are wave after wave of tech startups from all around the globe.</p> <p>We -- as human beings -- are on the cusp of a whole new era, witnessing the greatest technological paradigm shift yet.</p> <p>With endless possibilities ahead of us and future generations, it is crucial that we reinvigorate our “missions” in this world -- the value we create and pass on. Forward-thinking mindsets must take hold.</p> <h2>Enter education</h2> <p>Education is powerful. At the same time, it can be an extremely delicate subject. It is the epitome of things that are “easier said than done.”</p> <p>Think of any one school. The reality remains that children hail from vastly different backgrounds, often facing their own unique challenges. Not to mention how they all possess different levels of aptitude.</p> <p>What does this mean for frontline educators? How do educators go about providing the best learning environment tailored to empower the next generation of tech -- or even world -- leaders?</p> <p>I was recently invited to attend the iFuture Education Conference, which took place at Pak Kau College in Hong Kong. At the talk session, three prominent guests took turns sharing their insights -- offering thought-provoking takeaways worth reflecting upon.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_01.jpg" alt="01"></p> <h6>Pak Kau College Supervisor Prof. Tam Man Kwan offers an opening keynote address.</h6> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_02.jpg" alt="02"></p> <h6>Pak Kau College Principal Mr. Wong Wing Tung (William) offers an opening keynote address.</h6> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_03.jpg" alt="03"></p> <h6>Guest speaker Ray Lu presents on stage.</h6> <br> <h2>Ray Lu</h2> <p>After “surviving” the infamously abysmal ordeal that is medical school, Dr. Ray Lu didn’t go on to treat patients. Instead, he set out to care for the “health” of society as a whole.</p> <p>While in medical school, Lu took inspiration from the United States’ Khan Academy. He thought he would follow suit -- or give it a test drive at the very least. To test the waters, he went on to upload several self-recorded science lecture videos. Unlike the majority of Khan-style content at the time, his videos were produced in Mandarin.</p> <p>Much to his surprise, the videos ended up taking Taiwanese students by storm. Better yet, feedback began to roll in -- including what turned out to be huge support and encouragement.</p> <p>“One particular young student shared an anecdote with me...” Dr. Lu recalled. “If it weren’t for my videos, they wouldn’t have known that the ‘sin’ in geometry means sine, and not ‘sin’ as in violations!”</p> <p>Fast forward to many moons later. Lu is currently the CEO of Junyi Academy, focusing on the goal to offer a personalized learning experience for all ages. Junyi is essentially the Chinese version of Khan,  primarily serving the Chinese-speaking community in Taiwan.</p> <p>The team behind Junyi share another motto -- “empower every child.” Interestingly enough, it happens to align with Pak Kau College’s (the hosting school) motto of “all are educable.”</p> <p>Among Lu’s many takeaway points, he also discussed the concept of “teacherpreneur.” His view is clear and insightful: By positioning themselves as teacherpreneurs, educators can better prepare to do what AI cannot. e-Learning technology should be leveraged to aid teachers in their methodology; it is not intended to replace educational careers.</p> <p>As Ray Lu departed from the podium amidst keen ovation, the audience was equally exciting to greet the next visiting speaker.</p> <h2>Ryo Kuramoto</h2> <p>Mr. Ryo Kuramoto’s guest appearance completely debunks the myth that being a teacher is a leisurely job. His schedule was, in fact, so tightly packed that his first ever trip to Hong Kong had to be concluded in under 24 hours. Everyone in the audience, most of whom are also high school teachers, therefore felt especially grateful for the opportunity to hear him speak.</p> <p>Kuramoto is a science teacher at Ritsumeikan Moriyama High School, a certified Super Science High School (SSH). According to Wikipedia, “SSH is a designation awarded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) to upper secondary schools that prioritize science, technology, and mathematics.”</p> <p>There are only approximately 200 SSHs in Japan. At Kuramoto’s school in particular, over 90% of the senior students get accepted into Ritsumeikan University, a private school in Kyoto that traces its root to 1869.</p> <p>In addition to introducing SSH as a whole and the specific strategies at his school, Mr. Kuramoto also walked us through the information and communications technology (ICT) education from which his students benefit. The school’s “bring your own device (BYOD)” approach means students get to use iPads as a form of stationery on a daily basis.</p> <p>Towards the end of his speech, Kuramoto shared future vision for a “2020 revolution.” In essence, it involves “proactive, interactive, and deep learning.” I was particularly delighted to learn about the “interactive” bit, as it could very well help disprove the stigma that technology creates deepening isolation.</p> <p>During our round of applause, a random thought hit me out of the blue: If we were anywhere else in the world right now, it would probably be quite hard to fathom how multiple languages were used in one single conference alone. Luckily, the iFuture Education Conference took place in Hong Kong, where most people are accustomed to -- or can even fluently speak -- more than one language.</p> <p>The first two prestigious speakers brought us Mandarin, English, and a little bit of Japanese. Joining us next would be a renowned internet personality, offering his speech in our local Cantonese.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_04.jpg" alt="04"></p> <h6>Guest speaker Ryo Kuramoto presents on stage.</h6> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_05.jpg" alt="05"></p> <h6>Guest speaker Erwin Huang presents on stage.</h6> <br> <h2>Erwin Huang</h2> <p>To readers from Hong Kong, Erwin Huang needs no introduction. A serial entrepreneur with recent focuses on social and educational ventures, Huang is also an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). His specialties are primarily in entrepreneurship, as well as engineering practice.</p> <p>At HKUST, Prof. Huang’s groundbreaking way of teaching is intended to better equip students for independent, innovative thinking. Boasting this type of brainpower is typically recognized as one of the many entrepreneurial traits. Other traits commonly seen in successful entrepreneurs include: Having the courage to break out of one’s comfort zone, learning to learn, taking risks while having the skill sets to manage them properly, being resilient after setbacks... The list goes on.</p> <p>A good portion of Huang’s lectures incorporates case study of tech companies. Within each featured case, students are given the opportunity to personally experience the core product on offer. To date, all of his featured companies operate in the sharing economy vertical -- namely, Airbnb, a Hong Kong-born app called Gaifong, and Uber.</p> <p>Scrutinizing the sharing economy is a great (and fun!) way to explore social issues in consumerism, such as the idea of trust. Huang’s students are encouraged to ponder open questions surrounding trust, or any other relevant topics that pop up for that matter.</p> <p>Behind every case study, there is an additional learning opportunity -- the element of reflection. Through first-person experience closely followed by comprehensive reflections on said experience, Huang believes that students are well on their way to hone innovative thinking skills. Theoretical teaching alone, on the other hand, tends to be more unidirectional by nature.</p> <p>Here comes an even more exciting bit: Towards the end of each case study experience, Huang -- a media guru in his own right -- would put together an exclusive interview with the featured company’s executive(s). The interviews are the key to direct communication, which helps to further strengthen students’ awareness and execution of innovative thinking.</p> <p>Erwin Huang is not sitting on the success of this current semester. He is already mapping out ambitious plans for the next semester, geared towards propelling his proteges to the next level.</p> <p>While the underlying course material is designed for university students, Huang reassured the audience that the teaching framework could be applicable to primary and secondary students as well.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_06.jpg" alt="06"></p> <h6>A group photograph to commemorate the occasion. From left to right: Ryo Kuramoto, Principal Wong Wing Tung (William), Erwin Huang, Ray Lu</h6> <br> <h2>Strolling around Pak Kau</h2> <p>After the talk session, I had the privilege to speak with the guests in person to pick their brains. Having the least amount of teaching / entrepreneurship experience of them all, I found our conversations to be exceptionally humbling.</p> <p>The next order of business was for me to take a brief tour around Pak Kau College. Seeing as how the workshops were specifically designed for incumbent teachers, I opted to delve into several STEM exhibition booths instead. And boy, was my mind blown!</p> <p>Teams of students were proudly showcasing what they had built from the ground up. A maker at heart, I was practically a kid in a candy store. There was a micro:bit-powered watering and fanning system, a Jimu robot performing pre-programmed dance moves, and another one coded with the capabilities to detect and take down “enemies” -- just to name a few of the offerings.</p> <p>The process of programming robots to perform specific tasks is not only a superb way to teach students about logic, it is also an unparalleled opportunity to encourage them to solve problems collectively in team settings.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_07.jpg" alt="07"></p> <h6>Pak Kau students participating in a variety of robotics projects. From left to right: Donald Ma, Timothy Ng, Natalie Lau</h6> <br> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-06-23_iFuture-Education-Conference_08.jpg" alt="08"></p> <h6>Supporting teachers behind the tech projects. From left to right: Ms. Li Lai Kuen, Mr. Luk Chi Hang, Assistant Principal Au Hoi Kin, Mr. Wong Chun Wai</h6> <br> <p>There is more to the robots I stumbled upon than meets the eye. Out in the real world, top Pak Kau teams use them to win regional competitions like the Robofest. The winning teams would proceed to represent Hong Kong to compete internationally. Initiatives like these are instrumental in piquing students’ curiosity in technology from a young age.</p> <p>Technology is changing our lives faster than ever. Schools are no longer just a place for children to pick up knowledge; they have become incubators of sorts, inspiring the next generation of pioneers to invent even more impressive game changers.</p> <p>Look around. The next Steve Jobs or the next Bill Gates could be among the budding students you know now. What awesomeness is he or she taking part in? <b>∎</b></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
