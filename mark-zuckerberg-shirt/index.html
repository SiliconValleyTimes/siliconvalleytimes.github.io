Now you can too.</h1> <h5>By Kathy Li</h5> <h5>July 19, 2017</h5> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-18_zuckerberg-shirt_cover.png" alt="Cover"> <br><br></p> <p><strong>Singularity</strong> in technology (especially when it concerns the hypothetical invention of artificial superintelligence possessing greater-than-human intelligence) may be a fearful concept to some, including sci-fi fanatics.</p> <p>Singularity in clothing choices, however, seems to be amassing a growth in popularity within the startup community. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is one of the most eminent advocates of a minimalistic -- but not necessarily small -- wardrobe.</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-18_zuckerberg-shirt_01.png" alt="01"></p> <h6>Screenshot via Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook profile</h6> <br> <p>Zuckerberg believes that donning the same outfit to work every day enables him to focus his energy on more important decisions.</p> <p>When asked about his staple outfits during his first-ever public Townhall Q&amp;A in 2014, the then-31-year-old explained, “I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community.”</p> <p>“I'm in this really lucky position, where I get to wake up every day and help serve more than a billion people. And I feel like I'm not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life,” He said.</p> <p>Not all of us are in his same position yet, although we can certainly aspire to be. Klaus Buchroithner, CEO of Vresh, has started by making the famous “<a href="https://www.zuckerbergshirt.com">Z-shirt</a>” slightly more accessible.</p> <p>“I've been producing fashion all my life. [I’ve] always wanted to create something unique and special that people love, with great quality, sustainable and fair.”</p> <p>Inspired by Zuckerberg’s idea and in hopes to follow <strike>shirt</strike> suit, Buchroithner began his comprehensive research on the Z-shirt. He found out that it’s made by Brunello Cucinelli, whom he thinks is an amazing fashion designer with a great hand for fabrics.</p> <p>“Unfortunately you can't buy Mark's shirts in Brunello's store. So I decided to design and produce a replica that is as close to the original as possible,” Buchroithner shared.</p> <p>“I was quite satisfied with the results and thought it would be quite cool to make them available to everyone who's interested. It definitely helped me to get a great start into the day and more important it really feels great when I wear it.”</p> <br> <p><img src="/assets/img/2017/2017-07-18_zuckerberg-shirt_02.png" alt="02"></p> <h6>Photo courtesy of Vresh CEO Klaus Buchroithner</h6> <br> <p>At 40 euros apiece, some netizens have expressed thoughts of the Z-shirt being an overpriced offering. Others have pointed out -- in fairness -- that “fast food” clothing items’ cheap prices are often a result of workers being exposed to unethical sweatshop conditions.</p> <p>Speaking of ethics, Buchroithner has also stated that 100% of the profits generated through shirt sales will be donated to the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a>.</p> <p>When all is said and done, the Z-shirt would probably make a great feel-good piece, both mentally and physically. <b>∎</b></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
